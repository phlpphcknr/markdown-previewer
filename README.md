In the frame of FreeCodeCamp I built this app. Check: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer

The website allows to enter code in Markdown and provides a preview of the out put. Marked (https://marked.js.org/) is used for the conversion from Markdown to HTML. Then styles are refined using CSS.

It is deployed on GCP Cloud Run using Docker.

Enjoy to try and play!

Cheers, Philipp
